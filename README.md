# Odin Recipes

This is the first project of [The Odin Project]. It serves as a recap and revision of everything learned so far — from understanding basic HTML tags such as paragraph tags, heading tags, image tags, anchor tags, etc., to learning how to form proper GitHub commits for better readability and collaboration.

While basic HTML elements can be learned from countless resources on the internet, what I truly appreciate about this project are the **principles** it instills — such as writing clean code, committing meaningfully, and structuring projects with intention.
